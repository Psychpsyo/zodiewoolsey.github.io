            Hi, I'm Zody Woolsey. I'm a young software developer/engineer / programmer.<br />
            I love writing code and love coming up with fun ideas to build or play with.<br /><br />
            Please keep in mind that this site is pretty ugly and needs to be updated.<br />
            This site was designed, initially, for an intro class where the professor told me that I couldn't use javascript and that I could only use the css he tought us.... so yeah.<br />
            It needs to be updated...
            <!-- if you are looking through my code, you might notice that I am overusing break tags.
                I was once told that the <br /> tag is a disgrace to the html world and should never be used... so I decided to overuse it in almost all of my projects.
                I like the break tag, it's a quick, easy, dirty way to add spacing.
                The professor (Who is one of my favorites) also told us we would get an automatic F on any assignment if we used a break tag...... so I used an <hr /> tag that was styled to hide the line so I could test to see if he would notice and give me an F.
                He either didn't give me an F or didn't notice :D
            -->
