                <p>My favorite food is Mac and Cheese! But, not any Mac and Cheese, only the kind that is extra thick and goopy but still has a melted cheese tatse that is not too dry. I am the kind of person who really likes salty foods, so cheddar cheese is certainly my favorite cheese, even for Mac and Cheese! </p>

                <p>As you can see by the image above a bowl of well cooked noodles and a nice easily meltable cheese is the perfect combination for a lazy snack/meal. It appeases the typical american unhealthy craving and is fairly delicious as well!</p>

                <p>I am not really sure what else to say about Mac and Cheese. I know you know what it is
                    and I am pretty sure that everybody likes it! The only issue is that there is no real way for you to send feedback on you Mac and Cheese status.... Hmmmmmmmmmm...
                    I suppose this could come in a later update to the site?
                </p>
                <p>But how much work would that really be? Ha Ha Ha... . . . </p>
                <p>Not much, actually. I wouldn't really be able to make any super cool solutions, though because I don't think github allows serverside code execution. That means that I can't really just go out and initialize a database on my github.io site. And, since that is what I currently use for my site hosting &DoubleVerticalBar; Becuase it's free!!! &DoubleVerticalBar; I will be quite limited from what I understand.</p>
